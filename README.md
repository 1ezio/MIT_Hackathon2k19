A solution towards one popular problem to ease the doctor off his burden towards the medicines and also the dosage one has to prescribe with them.

We aim to solve the current persisting problem of how doctors and other medical practitioners are under dire pressure and adept frustration that is pretty much displayed in their hand writing. As the medical research and development is able to come up with much amazing and miracle drugs, all the burden unfolds over the doctors as they must be well equipped with the latest and the best solution available that is able to cure the patient or improve his conditions, much better than once possible with the former means.

The below application is our take on this problem. The application is able to maintain medical records and other details necessary in the medical sector, in a much efficient and proper way. As we move onto the new era that has embraced the technology in all aspects of life. 

## Key Features :
- We will be using appropriate datasets to accommodate our model for a better functioning using the conventionally available machine learning techniques.

- The application would be made readily available for android devices , depending on the doctorâ€™s choice he/she can use any mode for this application.

- Each hospital would have a seperate locally available host that it would work on, hence all the data and sensitive information would be available only to the registered employees at the hospital, i.e, the doctor, the receptionist and the manager.

- This application will work on the desired language i.e. doctors will have option to choose their respective local languages.

- Using the available means we are able to precisely predict the medicine and dosage and also take the chronic diseases and the allergies one person has.

- Every patient would have a unique patient ID, which can be used to track his data on the application.

- The patient would be eigible to recieve sms and email about the further updates about the medical procedures and also be eligible to recieve his medical prescription as a pdf via a link in his email and text message. The link would rediret to an email containing the actual prescription as pdf.

- The patient can login to view their past prescription reports.


## Procedure of usage :
- The software upon installation every person from the institution would be registered to this application. They would be provided with a unique username and password, hence cannot be tampered with.

- The receptionist would be responsible for the registration process of the patients. The registration page would include his genral information including the BMI information and allergies of any form. 

- Any Patient upon entering the institution can be registered, proving him with a patient id that would be the key to this whole software.

- Now as we have a registered patient, he can be applied to have an appointment.

- Doctor upon logging in can trace the patient via entering his unique ID. Then he would be able to view this patient's details. No he must enter his symptoms and chronic allergies if any. 

- Then the algorithm would be able to predict the diseases and the medicines and thier dosages can be viewed, also the tests would be viewed.

- Now the doctor can add these medicines in the prescription area. Hence at the end of this, he can print the preview such that the doctor and the patient can have this information in black and white.
